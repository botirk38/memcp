- **Memory Augmented Generation (MAG)**

Enables models to generate context-aware outputs by retrieving from unlimited visual memory, grounding generation in rich, persistent visual context and past experiences.
- **One-Time Video Indexing**

Encode a video once and reuse the indexed data for multiple downstream tasks — a more cost-efficient solution compared to traditional video AI systems.
- **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**

Use state-of-the-art retrieval methods to find relevant video segments based on content, metadata, and context. Our video-native RAG system ensures fast and accurate search results, enhancing the user experience.
- **Natural Language Querying**

Query your indexed video data using natural language prompts. Easily retrieve specific segments, highlights, or insights — no technical expertise required.
- **Simplified Interface**

Index your videos effortlessly using a rich set of video understanding tools. Compressed indexing improves retrieval efficiency, enabling faster queries and better performance.
- **Flexible Templates**

Customize post-indexing pipelines to fit your specific needs. A variety of hyperparameters and templates are available to support tasks such as:
  - Scripting movies
  - Generating storyboards
  - Extracting highlights
  - Fine-tune the indexing process to match your use case.
