There are two main parts of our API platform:

- Authentication API: to provide safety usage of MAVI API and protect developers' video data, the platform requires every developer to follow an O2O authentication procedure to get tokens for calling MAVI-API. In this way, we minimize the risk of your personal data/token being stolen or hacked.
- MAVI API is REST-centric and compatible with most programming languages.
- MAVI utilizes a callback mechanism to improve developers' efficiency. While video processing takes time, developer could provide a callback endpoint for MAVI to notify developer of video processing status.
