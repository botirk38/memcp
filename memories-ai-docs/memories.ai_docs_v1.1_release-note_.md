Memories.ai introduces **API Key Authentication** to provide a simpler, more flexible authentication method for developers.

1. **API Key Authentication** – A straightforward method where a unique key is included in the request headers or parameters to authenticate API calls.
2. **O2O Authentication** – The original O2O method remains supported. Use this for applications that require enhanced security through two-step verification.
