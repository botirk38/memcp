Memories.ai introduces **sub account mechanism** to allow users to upload to Memories.ai with self-defined unique\_id in order to do user/folder/workspace/namespace management.

1. **unique\_id**: When uploading, searching, chatting, add `unique_id` as a parameter to specify the user/workspace/folder/namespace to process from.

2. **Version 1.1 deprecation**: We will deprecate Memories.ai API version 1.1 in 1 months. All the videos uploaded will still be accesible from the website.

### Auguest 2, 2025 [​](https://memories.ai/docs/release-note/\#auguest-2-2025 "Direct link to Auguest 2, 2025")

Memories.ai introduces **API Key Authentication** to provide a simpler, more flexible authentication method for developers.

1. **API Key Authentication** – A straightforward method where a unique key is included in the request headers or parameters to authenticate API calls.
2. **O2O Authentication** – The original O2O method remains supported. Use this for applications that require enhanced security through two-step verification.
