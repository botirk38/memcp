Memories.ai provides a [callback mechanism](https://memories.ai/docs/overview/#callback-mechanism) that notifies your program, application, or server about task status updates that may take significant processing time.

Providing a callback URL is optional and intended for convenience — you can always check task status manually by querying the metadata.
