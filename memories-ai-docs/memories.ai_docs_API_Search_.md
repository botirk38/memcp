Memories.ai stores videos like human memory by pre-indexing uploaded content. When needed, this stored context is retrieved intelligently and automatically, allowing the vision-language model to reason effectively. By integrating all available information, such as visual content, audio, text, and metadata, memories.ai builds a knowledge graph to enable comprehensive, deep understanding of videos.
